        </div>
        <div class='col-sm-10'>
          <p id='full_screen'>We are a group of people from all over Larkhall and the surrounding areas of Lanarkshire, and beyond. We want to worship and learn more about God together. We are a friendly mix of people from all generations, from tiny children right through to our older members.
At Larkhall Baptist we see ourselves as part of God’s family. We all want to be part of something exciting, in a place where God is really at work and where we can enjoy teaching, worship and fellowship together. Because of this whoever you are, and wherever you are from, we will always aim to give a good welcome here at Larkhall Baptist.
Bible study and worship are central to our church. We have opportunities throughout each week for people to be involved in age-appropriate Bible studies. Our Sunday worship services help us come together to worship God and learn more through the preaching of our pastor Stuart Wadsworth.
There are lots of activities on every week at Larkhall Baptist where you can learn more about who God is and how you can be fulfilled in Him.
We also want you to know the joy that comes from serving a God who enriches your life and gives you meaning. We want you to experience the love that comes from a community of people working together. We want you to be a part of all that’s going on here!</p>
